# Overwrite the default success / error messages

For the actions new, edit, delete, you can overwrite the default notices with your own:

~~~yaml
edit:
  params:
    messages:
      success: "Your movie has been updated"
      error: "Oops, an error occurred, and this was not saved."
~~~

Example: Suppose you wish to provide feedback to your user with ApiKey data stored in an autogenerated form field,  then 
you can use: '{$Model.getApiKey}' where `$Model` is your model short name object and getApiKey is the getter for the data.  
Now include this in the success message.

~~~yaml

edit:
  params:
    messages:
      success: "You've just registered a new application, thanks. Your consumer key is <u>{$Model->getApiKey()}</u>."
~~~

**Warning**<br />Don't forget the curly brackets `{$Model->getWhatever()}`.
